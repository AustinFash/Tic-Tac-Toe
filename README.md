# ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe Game 

I built this game using HTML + CSS + JS, and I wanted to practice OOP, Async Functions, and DOM manipulations

## Features 
- 2-player tic tac toe
- Win conditions that reset the game state to start again without refreshing the window
- JS updates the DOM as players take turns
- Visual game tracking as well as console log updates
